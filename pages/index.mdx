# Your Name

Hey, my name is Chase ðŸ‘‹

I am an engineer with a strong background in Customer and Developer Success, recognized for delivering exceptional technical support in collaborative, high-performance environments. In my previous roles as a Customer Success Engineer and a Developer Success Engineer, I successfully helped customers integrate and troubleshoot APIs and SDKs across web, mobile, and server platforms, ensuring client satisfaction and fostering strong client relationships. My technical proficiency, and pre and post-sales experience, combined with my dedication to delivering optimal solutions, uniquely position me to excel in customer-facing roles within the tech industry.

Right now, I'm learning everything I can about Vercel and Next.js, which is what this site is built with. I'll be making changes here as I learn more and more!

I'm currently looking for new opportunities in the Success Engineering space. If you're hiring, I'd love to hear from you!
